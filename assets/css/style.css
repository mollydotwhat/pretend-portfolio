TO DO:
    Add ids as appropriate
    Add classes as appropriate
    DECIDE ON DESIGN 
        - i like rounded corners, so should remember to set that
    make design function on MOBILE FIRST. accessibility!
    also remember FLEXBOX practice
        - will prob want to use gap function
        - use background-image in a specific container to style w/flexbox, instead of putting img tag in html and setting rules for that by itself
    also remember to use :first-child styling in works
